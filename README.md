# Adaptive-demand-response

Adaptive demand response with heterogeneous types of thermostatically controlled loads

This is a Matlab implementation of a demand response program in the framework of adaptive linear quadratic control.

The model of a district is designed in Matlab including different types of buildings, different building envelopes and energy systems. The code has been tested in Matlab R2022b. Compatibility with other Matlab version is not guaranteed.
